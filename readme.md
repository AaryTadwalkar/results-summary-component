## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS custom properties
- Desktop-first layout
- Google Fonts (Hanken Grotesk)

### What I learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of layout building using **Flexbox** and improve attention to spacing, alignment, and visual hierarchy.

I also learned:
- How to structure components cleanly using semantic HTML
- How to manage relative paths correctly for deployment on GitHub Pages
- How small CSS details (padding, border-radius, gradients) significantly improve UI quality

### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to:
- Improve responsiveness further with mobile-first breakpoints
- Refactor CSS for better reusability and scalability
- Use JavaScript to dynamically populate the summary data from `data.json`
